# Custom Chatbot
This is a simple python code to create a custom chatbot based on the OpenAI API that answers questions on specific input provided by the user.

The only code necessary to replace here is the API Key and the file path. This code automatically builds upon previously provided user context so quality of answers does improve over time. You can change the token number to increase the length of responses, change the temperature to adjust creativity (lower gives more specific responses, higher gives more broad responses), and you can change the engine to make it more or less powerful for your needs.

This program is meant to update previous code repositories that were outdated. The ideal use case of this program that I have found for myself has been using notes from coursework and then utilizing this program as a second voice while studying for exams.
